#DESCRIPTION:
This project is an E-Learning Platform front-end website created to simulate an online learning system. The website allows users to view course listings, open a course, watch embedded learning videos, and track their completion progress.
The website contains multiple pages such as Home, Courses, Video Player, and Dashboard with smooth navigation between pages. The user can mark a lesson as completed and the progress percentage updates dynamically using browser storage.
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate frontend development skills, clean layout design, page navigation, and interactive UI functionality without using any backend database. The interface is lightweight, simple, and works properly across different screen sizes including mobile and desktop devices.

#TECHNOLOGY USED:
HTML: page structure and navigation
CSS: layout styling, responsive design, and visual appearance
JavaScript: progress tracking and interactivity using local storage
EDITOR: Visual Studio Code
BROWSER: Opera GX
