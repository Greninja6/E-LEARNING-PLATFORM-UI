#DESCRIPTION:
This project is a basic E-Learning platform front-end website created to practice website structuring and navigation flow. The goal of the project is not to build a full production-level learning system but to understand how an educational website is organized and how users move between lessons inside a platform. The entire project focuses only on front-end behavior and visual interaction.

The website contains multiple pages including Home, Courses, Video Player, and Dashboard. The Home page acts as an entry point and provides navigation to other sections. The Courses page displays a list of available lessons using simple cards so users can easily choose a topic. After selecting a course, the user opens a video learning page where an embedded video is displayed along with lesson information.

A small progress tracking feature is implemented using browser local storage. When a user marks a lesson as completed, the completion percentage increases and stays saved even after refreshing the page. This does not involve login accounts or a database and is only used to demonstrate how websites can temporarily remember user actions.

The design is intentionally minimal and easy to read. Proper spacing, alignment, and simple colors are used so the interface remains understandable for beginners. The layout adjusts on different screen sizes including mobile and desktop without breaking structure. The project mainly demonstrates page linking, DOM manipulation, and storing small data in the browser.

This project helped in understanding navigation logic, UI layout arrangement, and how educational interfaces behave from a user perspective. It represents a beginner-level implementation of an online learning interface using only basic front-end technologies.
